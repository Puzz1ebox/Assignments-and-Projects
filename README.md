# Assignments

A collection of assignments (Penn State Erie, The Behrend College) and personal projects.  
Penn State assignments have been written in C++. For academic purposes only.  

Please feel free to steal my card designs if you find them to your liking.

All other projects that have been written in Python, VBA, SenseTalk, C#, and Java are proprietary.
