# Assignments

A collection of assignments (Penn State Erie, The Behrend College) and personal projects.  
Penn State assignments have been written in C++. For academic purposes only.  

Please feel free to steal my card designs if you find them to your liking.  
My template is also available to be used at your leisure that will allow you to create your own cards, assuming you know photoshop/GIMP.
